# Example Mapping File  created on 2010.01.03 21:21:46

# This is a comment. The line starts with '#'

# Lines containing Instructions / Configurations start with ':'
# Instruction Keywords are :table, :set, :update, :clearTable, :automap, :automapUpdate


# Name of Table you want to import the CSV-Data into
:table=my_table_name

# Mapping the CSV-Columns to the Database Table-Columns
# CSV-Column-Name = Database-Table-Column-Name
# If you want to insert String-Data you need to quote the CSV-Column-Name as done below (e.g. 'Name'=name).
'Name'=name
'Vorname'=firstname
'Email'=email


# If you want to update Data instead of inserting data, use :where and a condition.  
# Variable / References to the values in your CSV-Data can be used and must be written in curly Brackets. Syntax: {MyColumnName} 
# In this example the record to be updated must match the Emailadress in your CSV-Data.
#:update = where email = '{Email}'

# Option to clear Table before inserting Data
#:clearTable = false

# Option to Map CSV-Column-Names to Database-Column-Names if no Mapping is specified for a CSV-Column.
# For mapping a field on your own please see below in section 'Mapping Fields'
#:automap=true

#Update the Mappings below in this file when automap and automapUpdate option is true
#:automapUpdate=true

# Create a new CSV-Column while importing using PHP-Function.
# This option is very powerfull.
# In this example we are creationg a new column called 'mynewcolumn' containing the fields Vorname and Name
:set 'mynewcolumn'='{Name}' . ' ' .  'Voorname'

# You can create a new column to Import as a result of a subselect.
# In this example we are subselecting the userid from the table fe_users that matches the emailadress of the currnt row imported.
# In this case we can use the Variable user_id later in the import mapping process seem further down ('mynewcolumn' = fullname).
:subselect 'user_id'= select uid as user_id from fe_users where email = '{Email}'

# Some additional Mapping of fields 
# CSV-Column-Name = Database-Column-Name
user_id = userid 
'mynewcolumn' = fullname
